# Setting up Git & Github

Please follow the following instructions at the start of the course

1. If you do not already have a Github account, sign up for one at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Follow the instructions provided on [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) to install and set up git.
  - Note that I will be demoing things in the class using command line. While I encourage you to use the command line to follow what I'm doing, you are free to set up the GitHub Desktop client as well
  - In the "Authenticating with GitHub from Git" step, I strongly recommend that you follow the connecting over SSH setup
